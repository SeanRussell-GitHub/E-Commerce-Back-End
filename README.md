# **E-Commerce-Back-End**

## **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms is a great benefit to full-stack web developers.

This app was built for the back end of a fictional e-commerce site using Express APIs, Sequelize, a MySQL database, and Insomnia Core for testing routes and functionality.
#
## **User Story**
Project requirements:
```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```
#

## **Using Sequelize in sync with a MySQL Database**

This app uses Sequelize in sync with a MySQL Database to store values for the eCommerce store. These values can be anything, but for this project we used seed items such as running shoes, tshirts, hats, etc. Some of these products are linked through their tags, which is reflected in the queries for items sharing similar attributes (*see walk-through video, link below).

#
## Mock-Up

The following images shows the database's functionality through Insomnia Core:
